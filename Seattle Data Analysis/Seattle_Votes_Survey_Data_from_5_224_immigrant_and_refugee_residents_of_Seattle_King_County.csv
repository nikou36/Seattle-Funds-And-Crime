We need more than meetings. The police and the city need to vamp up their relationships with the community.  Most immigrant parents generally respect and like the police. However, the police have not done what it takes to meet these communities where they are.   Families can benefit from workshops for about how to speak with kids about drug/alcohol use, police procedures when kids get caught up in the ""system"", what is their rights etc.   Parents feel they do not have the resources to raise young men in this country because of language, education, and cultural barriers.   Police can not police these communities the same way they do other communities.

I was born in the USA and I am a US citizen; however, I grew up in Iran. Therefore, I have accent when I speak like most immigrants. My accent combined with my middle eastern heritage and the events especially after 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran and later 9/11 has made me prone to discrimination. I think it is very important to promote a welcoming environment in the city and especially the work environment. Seattle is doing a good job. As a matter of fact, I found a job with the City of Seattle because I believe I was victim of covert racism at my previous job. The other issue is the stereotypes and their relationship to religious beliefs. It is important to educate non-immigrants about how diverse other countries could be.
